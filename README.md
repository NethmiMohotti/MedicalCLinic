# MedicalCLinic
You are developing a scheduling system for a medical clinic. The system needs to efficiently store and manage the availability of each doctor. Each doctor's availability is represented as a series of time slots on specific dates, with a start time and end time for each slot.

Explain an optimal data structure (or combination of structures) in Java, C++, or C# that can effectively represent a doctor's availability information.

Note: Mention how you are using the specific data types to store the relavant information as well.

Example Data:

For Doctor John:
August 17th, 2024: 5:00 PM - 11:00 PM
August 18th, 2024: 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM
August 19th, 2024: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
